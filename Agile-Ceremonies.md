**How Ceremonies Align Teams**
Agile ceremonies translate high-level goals into a predictable rhythm of transparency, feedback, and adaptation
1.Predictability: They replace random interruptions with scheduled "sync points," ensuring everyone knows when and where to discuss blockers or changes.
2.Shared Goals: Sprint Planning and Backlog Refinement ensure the team and stakeholders agree on exactly what is being built and why.
3.Rapid Course Correction: The Daily Stand-up provides a 24-hour feedback loop to catch errors early, while Sprint Reviews align the product with user needs before too much is built.
4.Continuous Improvement: Retrospectives allow the team to pause and fix their own internal communication issues, ensuring the "how" of their work is constantly evolving.
5.Visual Clarity: Using a Task Board during these ceremonies provides a "single source of truth," so anyone can see the project's status at a glance without needing a meeting.

For a backend intern, Backlog Refinement is crucial for aligning the frontend and database on data structures to avoid future rewrites. Daily Stand-ups are equally important for staying updated and getting timely help with technical issues.
