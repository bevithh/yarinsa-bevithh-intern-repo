# Reflection

I always check the sender email addresses before I reply or click the attached link or files. I enabled 2AF where possible and have strong unique passwords but my passwords are quite similar and repetitive across many platforms and sometimes I don't lock my devices when I'm away in public setting.

**Make secure behaviour a habit** by
1.Start reminding myself to lock my devices when I'm away and stop thinking that usually nothing bad happens when I didn't
2.Set a gentle reminder to remind me of what i should do once in a while
3.Use "habit stacking" like After my break time comes, I will lock my laptop before going outside.
4.Learn and understand the casue, danger, and consequences of risking what should've been prepared.

**Steps to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure**
1.Creating a strong password. A strong password is: At least 12 characters long but 14 or more is better. A combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
2. Don't use same password on multiple sites.
3.If you do shared same password across many sites, change that immediately.
4.Use password manager.
5.Don't share our passwords and personal credentials with non trustworthy individuals.

**If you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity**
Change all compromised passwords, contact financial institutions to freeze accounts/cards, and enable multi-factor authentication. Report the incident to relevant authorities and monitor accounts for further unauthorized activity. 

I monitor spams and verify the sender addresses before reponse to anything Focus Bear related.
