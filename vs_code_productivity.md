# Editing

Multi-Cursor (Manual): Option + Click — Adds a cursor exactly where you click, allowing you to edit different lines at once.

Select Next Occurrence: Cmd + D — Selects the next matching word, great for renaming a variable in a few places quickly.

#Personal Reflection
Which shortcuts do you think will be the most useful in your daily work?
The Multi-cursor shortcuts (Cmd + D and Option + Click) are easily the most useful. As a backend intern, I often find myself renaming variables or updating multiple lines of configuration at once. These allow me to do in three seconds what used to take a minute of manual clicking.

# How can keyboard shortcuts improve your productivity?

Keyboard shortcuts keep me in the flow state. Every time I reach for my mouse, my focus breaks slightly. By staying on the keyboard, I can navigate my project and edit code with much higher accuracy and speed, reducing "mental overhead" and fatigue during long coding sessions.
