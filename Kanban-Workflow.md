# Reflection

**Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload**
_The Pull System_: You only take on new work when you have the "space" for it. This ensures you are always working on the top priority without a manager having to constantly assign you tasks.
_WIP Limits (Work In Progress)_: By setting a strict cap on how many tasks can be in the "Doing" column at once, Kanban forces you to finish one thing before starting another.
_Visual Transparency_: Because every task (and every "Blocker") is visible on the board, your workload is obvious to everyone.

You can improve your workflow by visualizing every task on your board to eliminate "hidden work," strictly limiting your work-in-progress to avoid multitasking between different services, and focusing on moving existing tickets to "Done" before pulling in new ones to ensure a steady and high-quality output.
