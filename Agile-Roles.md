# Reflection

My Role: Backend Intern
My primary responsibility is to build, maintain, and test the server-side logic, databases, and APIs that power the application.

*How You Contribute to the Agile Process*

Sprint Planning: provide "story point" estimates on how difficult a backend task is.
Daily Stand-up: briefly share what you I yesterday, what I'm doing today, and if I have any "blockers".
The Increment: deliver functional code at the end of the sprint that meets the Definition of Done (code is reviewed, tested, and merged).

Role,How You Interact / Overlap
Product Manager,"They explain the business requirements. You might tell them, ""We can't launch that feature yet because the database structure doesn't support it."""
Frontend Devs,"This is your most frequent interaction. You build the APIs, and they consume them. You must agree on the ""Contract"" (the shape of the JSON data) before either of you starts coding."
QA (Quality),"Once you finish a feature, QA tests it. If they find a bug, they ""bounce"" the ticket back to you. You'll work together to reproduce the error and fix it."
Agile PM / SM,"If you are stuck on a technical setup or waiting for a senior dev to review your code, you tell the Scrum Master so they can ""clear the path"" for you."
UX Designers,"While you don't do visuals, you consult with them to ensure the data they want to display actually exists in the backend."
