# Which tool you used

I installed Cursor, which is an AI-powered fork of VS Code.

## What you used it for

Understanding Logic: I used the @Codebase chat feature to ask questions about how my project's backend modules are connected.
Interactive Debugging: I used the chat to feed the AI my error logs and then worked with it to fix the issues. I found that I often had to help the AI debug by providing more context about my local setup and specific logic it didn't catch at first.

## What it helped with
It was a huge help when I hit wall with error messages. Instead of just giving me a generic answer, it looked at my actual code and suggested specific fixes. It saved me a lot of time that I would have otherwise spent searching online for similar bugs.

## What it struggled with
It struggled with the initial setup and permission issues. I had to guide it through the process of why my environment wasn't responding correctly. It also sometimes suggested fixes that were a bit too generic, so I had to step in and refine its suggestions to make them work for my specific project.
