# Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?

I have used Git extensively both for my current internship and for previous university projects. In my internship, I use it daily to manage backend code, create branches, and push changes to our shared repository. Previously, I used it for a university assignment involving a spam detection model, where I learned the basics of cloning repositories and managing local project folders.

## Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?

I chose to use the integrated Git tools in VS Code. It is more efficient for my workflow because it allows me to stage, commit, and push changes directly from my code editor without switching windows. I also find the visual "Merge Editor" in VS Code incredibly helpful for identifying and resolving merge conflicts quickly, which makes collaboration much smoother.

## What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

The most interesting thing I learned is how Git stores data as snapshots of a project over time, rather than just a list of file changes. Every time I commit, Git basically takes a picture of what all my files look like at that exact moment. I also found it fascinating that Git was created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, and that the word "Git" is actually British slang for an "unpleasant person".
