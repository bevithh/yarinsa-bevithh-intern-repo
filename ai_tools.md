# Which AI tools did you try?

I installed the GitHub Copilot extension for VS Code and used ChatGPT to help troubleshoot technical environment issues.

# What worked well? What didn’t?

Copilot was great at predicting small snippets of code and boilerplate. ChatGPT worked well for explaining the logic behind SSH configurations and fixing permission errors. What did not work as well was trusting the AI for very specific repo names or complex local paths, which still required manual checking.

# When do you think AI is most useful for coding?

AI is most useful when I am learning a new framework or need to quickly understand a specific error message. It acts like a senior developer who can give me a hint when I am stuck on syntax or setup steps.
