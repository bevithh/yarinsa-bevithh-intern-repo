# What makes Focus Bear stand out?
Most apps are either just a blocker or just a habit tracker. Focus Bear is like a mix of both. It’s unique because it cares about your physical health forcing those "microworkouts" so you don’t end up with a sore back after a long day of backend work.

# Why would I actually use it?
I sometimes get "hyper-focused" on a bug for three hours and forget to blink, Focus Bear is a lifesaver. The way it guides you through a morning routine and then locks you into "Deep Work" mode is perfect for staying on track without having to think about it.

# What’s missing?
I think it could learn a thing or two from Tiimo's visuals. Focus Bear can feel a bit "wordy" sometimes. Having a simple, visual countdown or a circular timer (like Tiimo has) would make it much easier to see how much focus time is left without reading a bunch of text.

# How could it be better?
The biggest win would be Smart Scheduling. As an intern, my schedule changes fast. If the app could just "know" my calendar and suggest a "Developer Habit Pack" automatically, it would save so much time on manual setup.
