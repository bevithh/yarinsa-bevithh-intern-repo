# Why was Focus Bear created?
I believe Focus Bear was made to help people who find standard productivity tools too weak. It was designed by people with neurodivergent brains who realized that just blocking an app is not enough. They wanted a system that actually leads you through your day and helps you stay on track when your brain wants to wander.

# What problem is Focus Bear solving?
It solves the problem of getting stuck or overwhelmed by too many choices. For someone like me who manages different tasks, it stops the feeling of redundancy where you have to check multiple apps for the same goal. It takes away the need for constant willpower by automating the focus process.

# Why is this mission important?
This mission matters because many smart people struggle at university or work not because they lack skill, but because they can not filter out the noise of the digital world. By helping people find their flow, Focus Bear allows them to actually use their talents instead of wasting energy fighting distractions.

# How does Focus Bear align with your personal values or interests?
As a developer, I value logic and efficient systems. Focus Bear’s goal of turning a messy day into a structured, guided routine aligns with my interest in building technical solutions that make life simpler and more organized.

# Do you personally relate to these challenges?
Yes, I relate to the stress of having information spread across too many places. When my setup is too manual or redundant, it is much harder to stay focused on the actual code. I also know how easy it is to hyper focus on a technical bug and forget to take a break or move on to the next important task.
