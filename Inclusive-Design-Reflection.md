*How to adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates*
Moving away from relying on implicit social cues, indirect language, and rigid, fast-paced interaction styles.
Focus on clarity, directness, and flexibility to ensure information is accessible and comfortable for all cognitive types. 

*Some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive*
*Aggressive onboarding: Immediately blocking app switching upon signup without a "default/nothing" state can overwhelm users.
*Intrusive "Strict Mode" and Limited Flexibility: "strict mode" can create anxiety if a user cannot easily pause for a legitimate distraction or emergency.
*High Setup Complexity: multiple, complex permissions (usage access, overlay permissions) can be difficult for non-technical users to set up.
*Information Overload: The interface may be too cluttered for neurodivergent users who struggle with cognitive overload.
*Lack of Immediate Value: If the AI-powered blocker is too restrictive or misinterprets user intent (e.g., blocking necessary work tools), it can cause frustration rather than focus.
*Accessibility Options Gaps: some features like reducing motion (disabling animated bears) are not yet available on all platforms.
*Unclear Tone/Feedback: In some contexts, if error messages or prompts are not clearly articulated or supportive, they can make the user feel punished rather than assisted.

To improve, focus on providing a more gradual, customizable, and less intrusive experience that caters to the user's immediate, context-dependent needs.
For example, implementing "Easy Read" or "Plain English" standards for all documentation, forms, and communication.
