# Reflection

**The Biggest Benefits of Agile**
Faster Time-to-Market: Instead of waiting six months to launch a "perfect" app, the team releases a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) early. This allows the company to start getting value and user data immediately.

High Adaptability: If a competitor launches a new feature or a major bug is found, Agile allows the team to pivot in days rather than months.

Increased Transparency: Tools like Kanban boards or Daily Stand-ups ensure everyone knows exactly what you’re working on and where the bottlenecks are.

Improved Quality: Because testing (QA) happens continuously throughout the cycle rather than just at the end, bugs are caught while the code is still fresh in your mind.

**The Biggest Challenges of Agile**
Scope Creep: Because Agile is so flexible, "just one more small feature" can constantly be added, making it hard to define when a project is truly "finished."

Meeting Fatigue: Between Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Planning, and Retrospectives, developers sometimes feel like they have less time for deep, focused coding.

Documentation Debt: Since Agile prioritizes "working software over comprehensive documentation," technical docs can sometimes fall behind, making it harder for new interns like you to onboard.

Uncertainty: For people who prefer a long-term, rigid roadmap, the "plan as we go" nature of Agile can feel chaotic or stressful.

Scrum is a structured, time-boxed approach where your team commits to a set "sprint" of backend tasks every two weeks, whereas Kanban is a fluid, continuous flow where you pull the next highest-priority ticket as soon as you finish your current one.
