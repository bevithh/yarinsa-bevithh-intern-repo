# Reflection

Use AI for assistance with brainstorming, summarizing, and routine, time-consuming tasks to boost efficiency, but rely on your own skills for critical thinking, original research, and final decision-making to maintain skill development

**Avoid over-reliance on AI**
positioning AI as a collaborative tool (a "co-pilot") rather than a replacement for human intellect

**Ensure data privacy** by
1.Classify Data Sensitivity: Before using an AI tool, I will classify data as Public, Internal, Confidential, or Restricted to apply appropriate security controls.
2.Practice Data Minimization: I will limit the input of personal or sensitive information to the absolute minimum necessary for the task.
3.Anonymization and Redaction: Before inputting data, I will remove or replace personal identifiers (names, addresses, account IDs) with placeholders
4.Disable Data Training: Manually opt-out of "Improve the model" or similar settings in AI tools (e.g., in ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) to prevent sensitive information from being used in future training.
5.Update Security Protocols: AI tools and plugins will be kept up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches.

When using AI tools at Focus Bear i will not put sensitive, confidential, or private information into public AI tools. I will treat the output as a draft or a starting point, rather than a finished product. I will verify and fact checks then edit and refine content then test the code and keep the record of the chat and prompt safely.
