# What do you hope to learn?

I’m really looking forward to seeing how a professional team operates in a real-world setting. I want to understand how a large-scale project is structured and how different parts of the backend come together to create a working product.

## What skills are you excited to develop?

I’m most excited to level up my technical stack, especially with NestJS and Docker. I also want to become much more comfortable with Git and the terminal so I can manage code changes efficiently alongside other developers.

## What can you contribute?

I’m bringing a fresh perspective and a strong work ethic to the team. I’m eager to apply what I’ve learned in my studies to actual tasks and help the team move through the technical backlog.

## What area would you like to improve?

I’d like to build more confidence with dev environment setups and system permissions. I’ve had a few technical hiccups getting my workspace ready, and I want to get to a point where those technical configurations feel like second nature.

## What does success look like?

Success for me is finishing my onboarding smoothly, becoming a reliable contributor to the codebase, and writing clean, professional backend code that my mentors are happy to use in the project.
